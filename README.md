# QLoRA in Code Summarization: How Far Are We?
We conduct the first empirical investigation into QLoRA, focusing specifically on method-level code summarization as a representative task that requires the model to identify patterns and structures across both natural and programming languages. Our study evaluates three state-of the-art CLMs across two programming languages: Python and Java. 

To recreate our Anaconda3 environment, you can run this command:

1. conda env create -n qlora -f conda_environment.yml
2. condea activate qlora
